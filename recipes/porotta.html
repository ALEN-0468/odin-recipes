    <ol>
        <li>Mix Ingredients: In a large bowl, mix 3 cups of refined flour (maida), 1 tsp salt, 1 tbsp sugar, and 2 tbsp ghee or oil. Some recipes suggest adding an egg or 1/4 cup of milk for extra softness.</li>
        <li>Knead: Slowly add water to the mixture and knead well to form a soft, pliable dough. Knead for about 5–10 minutes, pushing the dough with your thumb, until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Initial Rest: Apply oil (approx. 2 tbsp) all over the dough to prevent drying. Cover with a damp cloth or lid and let it rest for at least 1 to 2 hours. </li>
        <li>Divide and Roll: After resting, punch down the dough and knead again. Divide the dough into equal-sized small balls (beeda).</li>
        <li>Second Rest: Coat each ball with oil and allow them to rest for another 15–20 minutes. </li>
